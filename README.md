# Animating-Current-Weather
This is a site that allows you to input the place and country and an animation will appear with the weather in that place.
This project uses an API --> which should still work, and then there are more specific instructions on the website as to how to operate the site. 

PLEASE DO NOT USE THE API KEY.

This project was created so there was a fun away to be able to look at what the weather was in a specific space.
